## Subscription Requirements

The embed system is tied to your LYTE subscription:

- **Active Subscription**: Blog posts will display normally
- **Trial Period**: Full access during the trial period
- **Expired/Cancelled**: Posts will not be displayed, and a subscription message will appear
- **Past Due**: Posts will not be displayed until payment is resolved

## Security

- Embed tokens are unique to each client
- Tokens can be regenerated from the LYTE dashboard
- Tokens automatically expire when subscription becomes inactive
- All requests are rate-limited and monitored for abuse

## Error States

The embed system handles various states gracefully:

- **Loading**: Shows a loading spinner while fetching posts
- **Empty**: Displays a message when no posts are available
- **Error**: Shows error message if posts can't be loaded
- **Subscription Required**: Indicates when subscription is needed

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

## Performance

- Lazy loading of images
- Minimal bundle size (~10KB gzipped)
- No external dependencies
- Optimized for Core Web Vitals

## Customization

The embed system automatically inherits your website's font settings and provides a responsive layout that adapts to your design. For advanced customization needs:

1. **Theme Colors**: Use the built-in light/dark themes
2. **Layout**: Responsive grid automatically adjusts to container width
3. **Typography**: Inherits from your website's font settings
4. **Custom Styling**: Available through LYTE Enterprise plans

## Troubleshooting

1. **Posts Not Displaying**
   - Verify your embed token is correct
   - Check your subscription status
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Style Conflicts**
   - The component uses Shadow DOM to prevent style leakage
   - Contact support if you notice any styling issues

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce posts-per-page if loading is slow
   - Ensure images are being cached properly
   - Check network tab for any bottlenecks
